# Flexible_input_component
I created a flexible React input component that supports multiple variants (filled, outlined, ghost), sizes (small, medium, large), and states (disabled, invalid, loading). It includes features like labels, placeholders, helper/error text, a clear button, password toggle, and adapts seamlessly to both light and dark themes.
